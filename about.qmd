### I am George Whittington

As an undergraduate student majoring in statistics, I'm particularly drawn to the exciting field of machine learning. I love the process of building models and seeing how they can solve real-world problems. 

I actively use both R and Python in my work, and I'm committed to transparency and collaboration by making my projects available on public repositories.

If I could describe myself using three emojis I would select: 👾 😼 😁

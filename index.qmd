This website will be our Machine Learning course, where we explore various statistical and machine learning models using the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) 2023 dataset. Through this course, I learned to implement and understand different modeling techniques using the `tidymodels` framework in R.

### What You'll Find Here

- **About Me**: A little bit about me and my research interests.
- **The Dataset**: Information about my primary dataset and the research question I am trying to answer.
-   **Model Implementations**: Hands-on examples of different models to answer the question:

    -   Logistic Regression
    -   Lasso Regression
    -   Decision Trees
    -   Random Forest
    -   K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
